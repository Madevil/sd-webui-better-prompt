== Overview
Better Prompt was created to reduce the various inconveniences of traditional prompt input and editing. It allows you to set Textual Inversion and LoRA without displaying Extra networks (ðŸŽ´), rearrange the order of prompts by drag and drop, and adjust the emphasis level of prompts through a GUI.

== Installation
=== Installing from the Browser (Recommended)
You can install it from the "Install from URL" option in the Extensions tab. Simply enter https://github.com/eideehi/sd-webui-better-prompt.git in the "URL for extension's git repository" field and press the "Install" button.

=== Better Prompt is not displayed or the display is broken
By installing it using the above methods, the latest version will be installed. However, it may not work well with the version of Web UI you are using. If Better Prompt is not displayed properly, it may be possible to resolve the issue by using a different version.

TIP: You can change the version of Better Prompt from the Settings tab. For more information, refer to <<version_change>>.

== Usage
Better Prompt adds the part enclosed by the red line in the image below. We will explain how to use this added content from now on.

=== Prompt Addition Form [[input-form]]
Adding a prompt is done using the three elements shown in the following image.

image::docs/images/input-component.png[Image - Input Component]

==== [1] Prompt Input Field [[input-field]]
Enter a prompt in this field and press the Enter key to add the content to the positive prompt. Alternatively, press the Shift key while pressing Enter to add the content to the negative prompt. If there are Textual Inversion, LoRA, or Danbooru tags similar to the input content, they will be displayed in a list in <<suggest>>.

TIP: Fuse.js is used for similarity determination, allowing various determination methods such as "exact match," "prefix/suffix," and "AND/OR/NOT" to be used. For more information, refer to the https://fusejs.io/examples.html#extended-search[fusejs.io documentation].

TIP: Press the Tab key to move the focus to the elements in <<suggest>>, and press the Escape key to return the focus. The selected element can be added to the positive (negative) prompt by pressing Enter (or Shift + Enter).

==== [2] Suggest Filters
Only elements with a check in these filters will be displayed in <<suggest>>.

==== [3] Suggest Area [[suggest]]
Displays a list of up to 20 elements similar to the content entered in <<input-field>>. An example of the items to be added is shown in the following image.

image::docs/images/suggest-items.png[Image - Suggest Items]

Green is Textual Inversion, blue is LoRA, and the last is Danbooru tags. Clicking (or Shift-clicking) these elements allows them to be added to the positive (negative) prompt.

NOTE: LoRA cannot be added to the negative prompt, so please be careful.

TIP: You can check the thumbnail by right-clicking on the elements of Textual Inversion and LoRA.

=== Prompt Editing
Prompt editing is done using the two elements shown in the following image.

image::docs/images/prompt-component.png[Image - Prompt Component]

==== [1] Positive Prompt [[positive-prompt]]
Prompts added using <<input-form>> are displayed in this area. This element is synchronized with the positive prompt input area of the web UI.

TIP: Each prompt can be reordered by drag and drop, and can be deleted by clicking while holding the Shift key.

TIP: Right-clicking on LoRA and normal prompts displays a popup for adjusting the emphasis level.

==== [2] Negative Prompt
Except for not being able to add LoRA, it is the same as <<positive-prompt>>.

== Configuration
Better Prompt creates its own configuration section in the Settings tab. Here, we will explain each item.
